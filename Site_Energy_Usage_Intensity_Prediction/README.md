## Problem Statement

**Site Energy Usage Intensity (EUI) Prediction**

The project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the **Site Energy Usage Intensity (EUI)** for buildings based on various physical, operational, and environmental characteristics. Site EUI represents the total energy consumed by a building per square foot per year, making it a key metric for evaluating building energy efficiency.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Predictive Modeling**: Build regression models to accurately estimate Site EUI for buildings
2. **Feature Analysis**: Identify the most influential factors affecting energy consumption
3. **Energy Efficiency Insights**: Provide actionable insights for improving building energy performance
4. **Model Comparison**: Evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best performer

## Dataset

The WiDS Datathon 2022 focuses on a prediction task involving roughly 100k observations of building energy usage records collected over 7 years and 
a number of states within the United States. The dataset consists of building characteristics (e.g. floor area, facility type etc), weather data 
for the location of the building (e.g. annual average temperature, annual total precipitation etc) as well as the energy usage for the building and 
the given year, measured as Site Energy Usage Intensity (Site EUI). Each row in the data corresponds to the a single building observed in a given year. 
Your task is to predict the Site EUI for each row, given the characteristics of the building and the weather data for the location of the building.

## Data Characteristics

The dataset includes:
- **Target Variable**: `site_eui` (Site Energy Usage Intensity)
- **Features**: Various building attributes including:
  - Physical characteristics (size, age, type)
  - Weather and climate data
  - Energy sources and systems
  - Operational parameters
  - Geographical information

## Technical Approach

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Feature engineering and transformation
- Data normalization/scaling
- Train-test splitting

### Models Implemented:
1. **Linear Regression** (baseline)
2. **Random Forest Regressor**
3. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
4. **XGBoost Regressor**
5. **Support Vector Regressor**
6. **Neural Networks**

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared Score
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Business Impact

This solution helps:
- **Building Owners**: Identify energy inefficiencies and optimization opportunities
- **Energy Managers**: Prioritize retrofit and improvement projects
- **Sustainability Teams**: Track and improve environmental performance
- **Policy Makers**: Develop energy efficiency standards and incentives

## Challenges Addressed

1. **Complex Feature Relationships**: Multiple interacting factors affect energy consumption
2. **Data Quality**: Handling missing values and inconsistent data
3. **Non-linearity**: Energy patterns don't always follow linear relationships
4. **Generalization**: Creating models that work across different building types and locations

The project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline from data exploration to model deployment, providing a robust framework for building energy efficiency analysis.

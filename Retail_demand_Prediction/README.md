Problem Statement
Retail Demand Forecasting for Supply Chain Optimization

Core Business Problem:
The project addresses the challenge of accurately predicting product demand for retail stores to optimize inventory management and supply chain operations. Retailers need to forecast how many units of each product will be sold to:

Prevent stockouts - avoid lost sales due to insufficient inventory

Reduce overstocking - minimize storage costs and product waste

Optimize procurement - make data-driven purchasing decisions

Improve resource allocation - efficiently distribute products across stores

Key Components:
Data-Driven Forecasting:

Use historical sales data to predict future demand

Incorporate multiple factors affecting sales (promotions, holidays, seasonality)

Multi-Store Environment:

The solution appears to handle demand forecasting across multiple retail locations

Considers store-specific characteristics and performance

Time-Series Analysis:

Temporal patterns in sales data (daily, weekly, seasonal trends)

Holiday effects and promotional impacts

Technical Approach:
Based on the code structure, the solution involves:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Multiple machine learning models for comparison

Time-series forecasting techniques

Model evaluation and performance metrics

Business Impact:
Accurate demand forecasting enables:

Reduced operational costs through optimized inventory

Increased sales by ensuring product availability

Better customer satisfaction by meeting demand consistently

Data-driven decision making for retail operations

The project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in retail operations, focusing on solving real-world supply chain challenges through predictive analytics.

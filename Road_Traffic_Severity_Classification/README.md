# Road Traffic Severity Classification

The purpose of the Road_Traffic_Severity project is to develop a robust and data-driven solution for analyzing and predicting the severity of road traffic incidents. The primary aim is to empower traffic management authorities, transportation planners, and researchers with actionable insights to improve road safety, reduce accidents, and enhance traffic flow efficiency.

## About the Data : 

This data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments for master's research work. The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents of the year 2017-20. All the sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms.**

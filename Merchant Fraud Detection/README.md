## Problem Statement

**Merchant Fraud Detection System**

The project aims to develop a machine learning system to detect fraudulent activities by merchants in financial/payment transactions. It addresses the critical business problem of identifying dishonest merchants who engage in fraudulent practices that could lead to financial losses for payment processors, banks, or customers.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Binary Classification**: Distinguish between legitimate (0) and fraudulent (1) merchants
2. **Risk Assessment**: Analyze merchant transaction patterns to flag suspicious activities
3. **Feature Analysis**: Identify which merchant attributes and behaviors are most indicative of fraud
4. **Model Comparison**: Evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms to find the most effective fraud detection approach

### Data & Features
The system processes merchant data with features likely including:
- Transaction patterns and frequencies
- Payment amounts and types
- Merchant profile information
- Historical behavior metrics
- Geographic and temporal patterns

### Technical Approach
The implementation follows a comprehensive ML pipeline:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, normalization
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding data distribution and correlations
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Testing various classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Addressing the typical fraud detection challenge where fraudulent cases are rare

### Business Impact
This type of system helps financial institutions:
- Reduce financial losses from fraudulent merchants
- Maintain trust in payment ecosystems
- Comply with regulatory requirements
- Automate risk assessment processes

The project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in financial security and risk management, focusing on the specific challenge of merchant-side fraud rather than customer-side fraud detection.

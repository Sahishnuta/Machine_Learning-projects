## Problem Statement

**Primary Goal:** To classify particle collision events from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN as either **signal** (Higgs boson decay) or **background** (other particle interactions).

**Scientific Context:**
- Analyze high-energy physics data from proton-proton collisions
- Identify rare Higgs boson decay events among vast amounts of background noise
- Use machine learning to distinguish between genuine Higgs boson signatures and other Standard Model processes

## Key Technical Challenges

### 1. **Data Complexity**
- High-dimensional feature space (30+ kinematic variables)
- Imbalanced classes (signal events are rare)
- Missing values and noisy measurements
- Physics-derived features with complex correlations

### 2. **Feature Engineering Challenges**
- Handle missing values (-999.0 placeholder) appropriately
- Process kinematic variables like mass, momentum, energy measurements
- Deal with jet multiplicity and particle identification variables
- Engineer meaningful physics-based features

### 3. **Modeling Difficulties**
- High false positive rates due to class imbalance
- Need for calibrated probability outputs
- Interpretability requirements for physics validation
- Robustness to systematic uncertainties

## Project Structure & Approach

Based on the code analysis, the project implements:

### **Data Processing Pipeline**
- Missing value imputation strategies
- Feature normalization and standardization
- Jet multiplicity-based feature grouping
- Physics-inspired feature engineering

### **Machine Learning Models**
- **Logistic Regression** with regularization
- **Random Forest** for feature importance
- **Gradient Boosting** (XGBoost/LightGBM) for performance
- Neural networks for complex pattern recognition

### **Evaluation Framework**
- Physics-focused metrics beyond standard accuracy
- Significance-based evaluation
- Cross-validation strategies
- Hyperparameter optimization

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Binary Classification Model** that can reliably identify Higgs boson events
2. **Feature Importance Analysis** to understand discriminating variables
3. **Probability Calibration** for physics analysis applications
4. **Performance Metrics** suitable for high-energy physics requirements

## Real-world Significance

This project addresses a fundamental challenge in experimental particle physics - extracting rare signals from enormous background processes, which is crucial for:
- Higgs boson property measurements
- New physics searches
- LHC data analysis methodologies
- Machine learning applications in scientific discovery

The solution combines domain knowledge from particle physics with modern machine learning techniques to tackle one of the most important classification problems in contemporary physics research.

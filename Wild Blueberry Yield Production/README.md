# Wild Blueberry Yield Prediction

This project aims to predict the yield of wild blueberries using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for predictive modeling was 
generated by the Wild Blueberry Pollination Simulation Model, an open-source, spatially explicit computer simulation program.
The model allows for the exploration of various factors, such as plant spatial arrangement, outcrossing and self-pollination, 
bee species compositions, and weather conditions, and how they affect the pollination efficiency and yield of the wild blueberry agro-ecosystem.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of simulated data generated by the Wild Blueberry Pollination Simulation Model. This data has been 
validated using field observations and experimental data collected in Maine, USA, and Canadian Maritimes over the past 30 years. It serves as 
a valuable resource for researchers who have actual field data and those who want to experiment with machine learning algorithms on data generated 
by computer simulation models.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to predict the yield of wild blueberries based on various features. The target variable, **yield**, is 
a continuous variable. The task involves classifying this variable by step-by-step analysis of the other 17 features. The evaluation metric 
used for model performance will be the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) score.

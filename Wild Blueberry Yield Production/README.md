## Problem Statement

**Wild Blueberry Yield Prediction**

This is a **regression machine learning problem** to predict the yield (production) of wild blueberries based on various agricultural and environmental factors. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately forecast blueberry yield using features related to:

- **Pollination dynamics** (behaviors of different bee species)
- **Climatic conditions** (temperature, humidity, precipitation)
- **Plant characteristics** (fruit set, seeds, etc.)
- **Spatial/temporal factors**

## Key Objectives:

1. **Predict continuous yield values** for wild blueberry crops
2. **Understand feature importance** - identify which factors most significantly impact yield
3. **Compare multiple regression models** to find the best performer
4. **Handle agricultural dataset** with potential correlations and seasonal patterns

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of simulated data generated by the Wild Blueberry Pollination Simulation Model. This data has been 
validated using field observations and experimental data collected in Maine, USA, and Canadian Maritimes over the past 30 years. It serves as 
a valuable resource for researchers who have actual field data and those who want to experiment with machine learning algorithms on data generated 
by computer simulation models.

## Dataset Characteristics:

- **Target variable**: `yield` (continuous numerical values)
- **Features**: 17 different agricultural parameters including:
  - Pollinator metrics (`honeybee`, `bumbles`, `andrena`, etc.)
  - Climate data (`MaxOfUpperTRange`, `MinOfUpperTRange`, `AverageOfUpperTRange`)
  - Fruit characteristics (`fruitset`, `fruitmass`, `seeds`)
  - Growing conditions (`RainingDays`, `AverageRainingDays`)

## Technical Approach:

The project implements a **comprehensive machine learning pipeline**:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Correlation analysis, distribution studies
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, handling multicollinearity
4. **Model Training**: Multiple algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV for optimization
6. **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like RMSE, MAE, RÂ² score
7. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identifying key yield drivers

## Business/Agricultural Impact:

This type of predictive model helps:
- **Farmers** optimize cultivation practices and predict harvests
- **Agricultural planners** make informed decisions about crop management
- **Researchers** understand the complex relationships between pollination, climate, and yield
- **Supply chain** stakeholders plan logistics and distribution

The project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in precision agriculture and sustainable farming practices.

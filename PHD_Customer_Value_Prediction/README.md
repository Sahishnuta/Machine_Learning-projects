## **Probable Problem Statement**

**Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for a Business**

This appears to be a **regression problem** where the goal is to predict the future value or worth of customers to a business.

## **Key Components Analysis**

### **Business Context:**
- Companies want to identify high-value customers for targeted marketing
- Need to optimize resource allocation and customer retention strategies
- Aim to maximize return on investment in customer acquisition

### **Likely Data Characteristics:**
- **Target Variable**: Customer Value (monetary amount)
- **Features**: Customer demographics, purchase history, engagement metrics, behavioral data
- **Time-based**: Historical customer data to predict future value

### **Expected Machine Learning Tasks:**

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values in customer data
   - Feature engineering (RFM analysis - Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
   - Normalization/scaling of numerical features

2. **Model Development**
   - Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
   - Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, R-squared
   - Feature importance analysis

3. **Business Applications**
   - Customer segmentation (high/medium/low value)
   - Personalized marketing strategies
   - Customer retention programs

## **Common Challenges in CLV Prediction:**

- **Data Quality**: Incomplete customer records
- **Temporal Patterns**: Changing customer behavior over time
- **Model Interpretability**: Need to explain predictions to stakeholders
- **Class Imbalance**: Few high-value customers vs many low-value ones
